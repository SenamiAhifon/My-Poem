Ahahah!
Write a poem? 
I am not a poet, how sad!
But this is poem
Play with the words, play with the letters, let your mind wander
How calm, how refreshing, how passive
And oh! I have forgot, to tell you, see the sea, see the mountain, see the forrest and your mind keep wandering with a smile
How calm, how refreshing, how passive
Ahahah!
If I were a poet, how sad!
